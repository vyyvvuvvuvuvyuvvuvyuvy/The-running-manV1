I am and will be publishing new versions of the game as we speak V2 is out now and more will come.






The-running-manV2 web game code introduces a comprehensive overhaul that enhances both visual appeal and gameplay features compared to the first version. It adopts a modern, colorful design with gradient backgrounds, sleek menus, and animated elements like clouds and grass, creating a more immersive environment. The user interface is expanded to include a dedicated shop where players can purchase upgrades such as double jumps, speed boosts, and coin magnets using in-game coins, adding depth and replayability. The game mechanics now support collecting coins, unlocking abilities, and tracking total coins accumulated across sessions via local storage, encouraging players to strategize and improve over time. Additionally, the code organizes game objects like obstacles and coins into arrays that spawn dynamically, with visual effects like particle explosions upon coin collection and animated coins with rotation and glow effects, delivering a richer visual experience.

Furthermore, the second version incorporates features aimed at mobile compatibility with touch controls also including pc, allowing players to jump by tapping the canvas and pressing space key on pc. It also introduces a more sophisticated HUD displaying score, coins, and high scores, along with a dedicated shop interface for purchasing upgrades. The gameplay difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses, with obstacle and coin spawn rates adjusting automatically, keeping the game challenging and engaging. The use of local storage for high scores and coins fosters long-term progression, motivating players to keep playing and unlocking new abilities. Overall, this version transforms the original simple runner game into a more polished, feature-rich experience with improved visuals, interactive upgrades, and enhanced user engagement.

I am now working on V3.
